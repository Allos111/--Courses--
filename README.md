# --Courses--
This repository contains all my work of all the courses taken throughout my programming journey. The courses and problems are from the learning institutions and all the solutions are mine !!!

1. [Java-Programming-and-Software-Engineering-Fundamentals: A specialization from Duke University via Coursera](https://github.com/Allos111/--Courses--/tree/main/Java-Programming-And-Software-Engineering-Fundementals)

  [About this Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming?)

Take your first step towards a career in software development with this introduction to Java—one of the most in-demand programming languages and the foundation of the Android operating system. Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.

[Applied Learning Project](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming?)

Centered around projects, this Specialization will help you create a portfolio of work to demonstrate your new programming skills. In the capstone you will create a recommender engine similar to those used by Netflix or Amazon. Additional projects in your portfolio will include:an interactive webpage that applies filters to images, an analysis of CSV data files, an encryption program, and a predictive text generator.

2. [Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond](https://github.com/Allos111/--Courses--/tree/main/Object-Oriented-Java-programming-Data-Stuctures-and-Beyond/UCSDUnfoldingMaps)

[About this Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented)

This Specialization covers intermediate topics in software development. You’ll learn object-oriented programming principles that will allow you to use Java to its full potential, and you’ll implement data structures and algorithms for organizing large amounts of data in a way that is both efficient and easy to work with. You’ll also practice critically evaluating your own code, and you’ll build technical communication skills that will help you prepare for job interviews and collaborative work as a software engineer. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply your skills to analyze data collected from a real-world (social) network. Google has contributed real-world projects and the involvement of its engineers as guest lecturers to these courses. A small, select group of top learners who complete the Specialization will be offered practice interviews with Google recruiters.  Invitation to a practice interview does not guarantee an actual interview or employment.
